# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project is experiencing critical runtime errors and extensive TypeScript compilation failures across the backend codebase. The analysis reveals 50+ specific compilation errors including cache module dependency issues, missing type definitions, implicit any types, missing properties, and incorrect imports. These issues are preventing successful builds and causing runtime failures. A systematic approach is needed to resolve all identified errors and establish type safety throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all critical runtime errors and cache module dependency issues to be resolved, so that the application starts and runs without crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL resolve CACHE_MANAGER dependency without UnknownDependenciesException
2. WHEN cache module is initialized THEN the system SHALL properly configure cache-manager-redis-store
3. WHEN database configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use correct TypeOrmModuleOptions type
4. WHEN throttler module is configured THEN the system SHALL use proper factory function types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved, so that the project builds successfully without any type-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile without any TypeScript type errors
2. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL ensure all properties exist on their respective types
3. WHEN using function parameters THEN the system SHALL provide explicit type annotations instead of implicit any
4. WHEN calling repository methods THEN the system SHALL use correct parameter types and overloads

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing properties and enum values to be properly defined, so that property access and enum usage work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing AgentEventType properties THEN the system SHALL have all required event type values defined
2. WHEN accessing IUser properties THEN the system SHALL have passwordHash and organizationId properties available
3. WHEN accessing entity properties THEN the system SHALL have all required properties like requiresApproval and requiresAI
4. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL have all exported members available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import and module resolution issues to be fixed, so that all dependencies are properly resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing cache-manager-redis-store THEN the system SHALL have proper type declarations available
2. WHEN importing dockerode THEN the system SHALL have the module properly installed and typed
3. WHEN importing WebSocketModule THEN the system SHALL use correct module name (WebsocketModule)
4. WHEN importing helmet THEN the system SHALL use correct import syntax and callable function

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and type safety for unknown error types, so that error handling is robust and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling errors in catch blocks THEN the system SHALL properly type error objects instead of using unknown
2. WHEN accessing error properties THEN the system SHALL use type guards to safely access error.message
3. WHEN handling null assignments THEN the system SHALL use proper nullable types or optional properties
4. WHEN accessing potentially undefined properties THEN the system SHALL use optional chaining or null checks
