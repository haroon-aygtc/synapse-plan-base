# Tool Marketplace & Advanced Tool Builder - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tool Marketplace & Advanced Tool Builder system enables users to create, share, discover, and monetize custom tools within the SynapseAI platform. This system transforms the basic tool creation functionality into a comprehensive ecosystem where users can build sophisticated API integrations, share them with the community, and discover pre-built solutions for common business needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Visual Tool Builder

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create complex API tools using a visual interface with intelligent assistance, so that I can build integrations without writing code manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the tool builder THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop interface with component library
2. WHEN a user describes an API integration in natural language THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the tool configuration and schema
3. WHEN a user connects to an API endpoint THEN the system SHALL automatically detect authentication methods and parameter schemas
4. WHEN a user configures tool parameters THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation and preview of API calls
5. WHEN a user tests a tool THEN the system SHALL execute real API calls in a secure sandbox environment
6. WHEN a user saves a tool THEN the system SHALL validate all configurations and store versioned tool definitions

### Requirement 2: Tool Marketplace with Discovery & Sharing

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to discover and install pre-built tools from a marketplace, so that I can quickly add functionality without building from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display categorized tools with ratings, reviews, and usage statistics
2. WHEN a user searches for tools THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent search with filtering by category, provider, and functionality
3. WHEN a user views a tool THEN the system SHALL display detailed information, documentation, pricing, and compatibility
4. WHEN a user installs a tool THEN the system SHALL automatically configure it with guided setup and credential management
5. WHEN a user publishes a tool THEN the system SHALL validate it, generate documentation, and make it available for discovery
6. WHEN a user rates a tool THEN the system SHALL update marketplace rankings and provide feedback to publishers

### Requirement 3: Enterprise Tool Management & Governance

**User Story:** As an organization admin, I want to control which tools my team can access and ensure compliance with security policies, so that I can maintain governance while enabling productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sets tool policies THEN the system SHALL enforce approval workflows for tool installation and usage
2. WHEN a tool is used THEN the system SHALL log all activities and provide audit trails for compliance
3. WHEN a tool accesses external APIs THEN the system SHALL enforce security policies and credential management
4. WHEN a tool fails or behaves unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and debugging information
5. WHEN an admin reviews tool usage THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on performance, costs, and security metrics
6. WHEN a tool violates policies THEN the system SHALL automatically disable it and notify administrators

### Requirement 4: Tool Performance & Analytics System

**User Story:** As a tool creator, I want to monitor how my tools perform and are used, so that I can optimize them and understand their impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool executes THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics including latency, success rate, and resource usage
2. WHEN a tool is used across workflows THEN the system SHALL provide usage analytics and integration patterns
3. WHEN a tool encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and suggested improvements
4. WHEN a tool's performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert the creator and suggest optimizations
5. WHEN a user requests tool insights THEN the system SHALL provide cost analysis and ROI calculations
6. WHEN a tool is updated THEN the system SHALL track version performance and provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5: Advanced Tool Integration & Orchestration

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to chain tools together and handle complex data transformations, so that I can create sophisticated automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are chained in workflows THEN the system SHALL automatically handle data mapping and transformation between tools
2. WHEN a tool requires human approval THEN the system SHALL integrate with HITL workflows and pause execution appropriately
3. WHEN tools need to share context THEN the system SHALL provide session-based data sharing and state management
4. WHEN tools execute in parallel THEN the system SHALL coordinate execution and handle dependencies correctly
5. WHEN tools fail in workflows THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent error handling and recovery strategies
6. WHEN tools access knowledge bases THEN the system SHALL inject relevant context and maintain citation tracking

### Requirement 6: Tool Security & Compliance Framework

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure all tools meet security standards and handle sensitive data appropriately, so that the platform maintains enterprise-grade security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is created THEN the system SHALL scan it for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
2. WHEN a tool handles sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce encryption and data protection policies
3. WHEN a tool accesses external services THEN the system SHALL validate SSL certificates and secure connections
4. WHEN a tool is published THEN the system SHALL require security review and approval for public availability
5. WHEN a tool violates security policies THEN the system SHALL quarantine it and notify security administrators
6. WHEN tools are audited THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive security reports and compliance documentation
