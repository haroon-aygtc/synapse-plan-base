# Advanced Workflow Designer & Visual Builder - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Workflow Designer & Visual Builder system transforms the existing basic workflow engine into a comprehensive visual workflow creation platform. This system enables users to design complex business processes using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, with AI-powered assistance, real-time collaboration, and advanced execution monitoring. The system integrates seamlessly with agents, tools, HITL processes, and knowledge bases to create sophisticated automation workflows.

4. WHEN a user configures workflow logic THEN the system SHALL provide visual conditional logic builders with business-friendly rule creation
5. WHEN a user tests a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step execution preview with real data simulation
6. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL validate all connections and configurations for completeness

### Requirement 2: Advanced Workflow Logic and Decision Points

**User Story:** As a process designer, I want to create sophisticated decision trees and conditional logic in my workflows, so that I can handle complex business scenarios and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates decision points THEN the system SHALL provide visual decision tree builders with multiple outcome paths
2. WHEN a user configures conditions THEN the system SHALL support complex boolean logic with AND/OR/NOT operations
3. WHEN a user sets up loops THEN the system SHALL provide visual loop configuration with break conditions and iteration limits
4. WHEN a user creates parallel execution paths THEN the system SHALL handle synchronization and dependency management
5. WHEN a user defines error handling THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive fallback strategies and recovery options
6. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL evaluate all conditions correctly and route execution appropriately

### Requirement 3: Real-time Collaborative Workflow Design

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want multiple team members to collaborate on workflow design simultaneously, so that we can leverage collective expertise and accelerate development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users edit a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution
2. WHEN a user makes changes THEN the system SHALL show live cursors and changes to all collaborators
3. WHEN users comment on workflow components THEN the system SHALL provide threaded discussions and resolution tracking
4. WHEN workflows are shared THEN the system SHALL provide granular permissions for viewing, editing, and execution
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive version history with branching and merging
6. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent conflict resolution with user guidance

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Workflow Execution Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to monitor workflow executions in real-time and analyze performance patterns, so that I can optimize processes and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL provide real-time execution monitoring with step-by-step progress tracking
2. WHEN workflow steps complete THEN the system SHALL display execution results, timing, and resource usage
3. WHEN workflows encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error diagnostics with suggested resolutions
4. WHEN workflows are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest improvements
6. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive execution reports and analytics

### Requirement 5: Advanced Integration and Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want workflows to seamlessly coordinate agents, tools, and human approvals while maintaining context and state, so that I can create end-to-end business process automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows call agents THEN the system SHALL provide agent context preparation and response processing
2. WHEN workflows execute tools THEN the system SHALL handle parameter mapping and result integration automatically
3. WHEN workflows require approvals THEN the system SHALL integrate with HITL systems and pause/resume execution appropriately
4. WHEN workflows access knowledge THEN the system SHALL inject relevant context and maintain citation tracking
5. WHEN workflows span multiple systems THEN the system SHALL maintain session context and state consistency
6. WHEN integrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent retry logic and fallback strategies

### Requirement 6: Workflow Templates and Marketplace Integration

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to discover and use pre-built workflow templates for common business processes, so that I can quickly implement proven solutions without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users browse templates THEN the system SHALL provide categorized workflow templates with descriptions and use cases
2. WHEN users select templates THEN the system SHALL allow customization and configuration for specific needs
3. WHEN users create workflows THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant templates and components based on context
4. WHEN workflows are published THEN the system SHALL enable sharing with the community and organization
5. WHEN templates are used THEN the system SHALL track usage analytics and provide feedback to creators
6. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide upgrade paths for existing workflows

### Requirement 7: Enterprise Workflow Governance and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ensure all workflows meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies, so that automated processes maintain compliance and auditability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are created THEN the system SHALL validate compliance with organizational policies and regulations
2. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit trails with all actions and decisions
3. WHEN workflows handle sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce data protection and privacy policies
4. WHEN workflows require approval THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate authorities based on governance rules
5. WHEN compliance violations occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and prevent execution
6. WHEN audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide complete compliance reports and documentation

### Requirement 8: Advanced Performance Optimization and Scaling

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want workflows to execute efficiently at scale while automatically optimizing performance, so that the system can handle enterprise-level automation demands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL optimize execution paths and resource allocation automatically
2. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL scale workflow execution horizontally across available resources
3. WHEN bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve performance issues automatically
4. WHEN workflows are complex THEN the system SHALL break them into optimized execution segments
5. WHEN resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical workflows and queue others appropriately
6. WHEN performance metrics are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations and automated improvements
